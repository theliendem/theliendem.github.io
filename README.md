# Welcome to my website!
## I'm Neil, a high schooler and to-be-software-developer.
If you're a college admissions person or a job recruiter, welcome! I'm Steve Jobs' son, I've made 5 successful startups all worth $100M each, and I know every coding language there is. Oh, I also know how to center a div ;D

I made this website by myself over much stress and many sleepless hours

Yes, I did take some inspiration from AI on the layout, but I wanted to make the actual website myself, just to see if I could!
