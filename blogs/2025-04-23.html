					<p>"Don't let the hope of finding a better way prevent you from starting down the best path right now. This day won't come again."</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to my first blog post! Well, this is exciting. I hope I don't bore you all with my ramblings.
				</p>

				<h2>Quote breakdown:</h2>
				<p>What I take this quote to mean is, don't keep waiting until the perfect moment.
					Just do whatever it is you want to do <i>now</i>.
					It reminds me of another quote, something that goes like
					<i>"The best time to start was years ago, but you missed it. The next best time is now."</i>
					I like this one because I have a habit of waiting for the "most opportune" moment for something, when really the best time to do it is now.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second part of the quote is also interesting.
					<i>"This day won't come again."</i>
					I got this app on my phone that shows me how much of the year has passed on my lock screen.
					2025 is almost a third over. That's insane.
					It resonates with me because I remember thinking a couple years ago,
					"why do I need to worry about this college stuff. I've got three more years to go!"
					But all of a sudden, it's here. It's now. Those three years are gone.
					Had I gotten started then, I would've been in a much different place than I am now.
					But again, the best time to start was years ago, but I missed it.
					The next best time is now.
				</p>

				<h2>Ramblings</h2>
				<p>
					Well, today I added the blog feature.
					Whether I blog every day or once every three months is kind up in the air.
				</p>

				<p>
					Well idk how I'm gonna sign off on a digital blog. See ya, I guess. ðŸ˜ƒ
